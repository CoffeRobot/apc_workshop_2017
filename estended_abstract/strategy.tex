\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}

In 2015 the competition consisted in picking one object from each of the 12 bins of the shelf within 20 minutes. Each bin could contain from 1 up to 4 objects making the recognition and grasping of objects increasingly difficult. In order to design our strategy we had 3 main limitations to consider. First the PR2 could not reach the highest level of the shelf where 3 bin were located. Second two of the objects of the competition were bigger than the maximum aperture of the PR2 gripper. Third, it takes the PR2 about 30 seconds to raise the torso from the lowest position to the highest. Given the time requirements that operation resulted very expensive. Therefore our strategy consisted in starting from the lowest level of the shelf giving priority to the bins with one or two objects. Once the bins were cleared the PR2 would raise the torso to address the next level of the shelf. The more complex bins with multiple objects were left at the end disregarding the level they were located.
